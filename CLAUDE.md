# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py                     # run the game
python main.py --unlimited-gold    # debug flag -- every purchase always succeeds, gold never spent

pytest                             # full suite
pytest tests/test_grid.py          # one file
pytest tests/test_grid.py::test_non_path_cell_is_buildable   # one test
pytest -v                          # what CI runs (.github/workflows/tests.yml)
```

No linter/formatter is configured. `pyproject.toml` only sets pytest's `pythonpath`.

`Game()` and some `AssetManager` tests open a real pygame window; `tests/test_game.py` and
`tests/test_assets.py` force the SDL dummy video driver themselves
(`os.environ.setdefault("SDL_VIDEODRIVER", "dummy")` before pygame is imported), so `pytest` runs
headless with no extra setup anywhere, including CI.

## Architecture

`Game` (`game.py`) is the state machine and frame loop: it owns `Grid`, `Economy`, `WaveManager`,
and the live `enemies`/`towers`/`projectiles` lists, and drives `handle_events()` ->
`update(dt)` -> `render()` each frame. `load_level()` rebuilds all of that from a `Level` in one
call, so `reset()` / `advance_or_replay_level()` (win -> next level, or replay the last one) are
just "call `load_level` again."

### Content is registries, not conditionals

Towers (`TOWER_TYPES` in `tower.py`), enemies (`ENEMY_TYPES` in `enemy.py`), and levels (`LEVELS`
in `levels.py`) are all `{name: class_or_instance}` dicts. `Grid`, `WaveManager`, `ui.py`'s build
menu, and `Game`'s placement logic all iterate or index these registries generically -- adding a
new tower/enemy/level is subclassing (or a new `Level(...)`) plus one registry line, never a
change to the systems that consume it. `Tower.EXTRA_STATS` (label, attribute, format-fn tuples)
is how a subclass's special mechanic (splash radius, slow %, chain range, ...) shows up in the
stats panel automatically. `Projectile` (`projectile.py`) is a single data-parametrized class, not
one subclass per tower -- splash/slow/knockback/chain are just constructor args a tower's
`create_projectile()` passes in, and the hit-resolution algorithm doesn't care which combination
it got.

### Grid has two coordinate systems

`Grid` (`grid.py`) tracks the map at two granularities at once:
- **Coarse tile coords** (`col, row`; unit = `TILE_SIZE`, 64px) -- path, blocked cells, and the
  rendered mosaic. Comes straight from a `Level`'s `waypoints_tiles`/`blocked_cells`.
- **Subtile coords** (`anchor_col, anchor_row`; unit = `SUBTILE_SIZE`, `TILE_SIZE /
  SUBTILES_PER_TILE`) -- tower placement. A tower's footprint is always one tile's worth of area
  (`SUBTILES_PER_TILE x SUBTILES_PER_TILE` subtiles, currently 8x8) but can be *anchored* at any
  subtile, not just a tile boundary, which is what gives placement finer-than-a-tile precision.
  `SUBTILES_PER_TILE` must evenly divide `TILE_SIZE` (enforced in `Grid.__init__`) so every
  pixel<->subtile conversion is exact integer math.

`is_buildable`/`occupy`/`remove`/`is_occupied`/`get_tower` all operate in subtile coords; two
footprints collide if they overlap *at all* (checked against a flat `occupied_subtiles` set), not
just when their anchors match, so finer placement doesn't need anchors to line up on any grid.
`placement_anchor(x, y)` (pixel -> anchor, centered on the cursor) is deliberately **not** clamped
to stay in bounds -- an out-of-grid or edge-hugging anchor is left for `is_buildable` to reject,
rather than silently snapped somewhere the player didn't point at.

### Tower progression is two separate axes

1. **Leveling** (1 -> `MAX_LEVEL`, currently 3): generic on the `Tower` base class.
   `LEVEL_SCALED_STATS` names which attributes scale; `LEVEL_STAT_MULTIPLIERS` is the shared
   level->multiplier curve; `LEVEL_STAT_MULTIPLIER_OVERRIDES` lets one stat use its own curve
   instead (e.g. `BasicTower`'s damage). `upgrade()` always rescales from the level-1 base
   snapshot (`_base_stats`), never compounds on an already-scaled number.
2. **Specialization**: a one-time branching choice available only at `MAX_LEVEL`
   (`Tower.can_specialize`), picking one of two named options in `Tower.SPECIALIZATIONS` (each a
   `stat_multipliers` dict applied on top of current stats). Independent of `level` -- a maxed,
   unspecialized tower and a maxed, specialized tower are both `level == MAX_LEVEL`. Every tower
   currently shares the same two generic placeholder specializations from the base class; a
   subclass can override `SPECIALIZATIONS` to offer its own.

`Tower.total_invested` (base `cost` + every upgrade/specialization cost actually paid) is what
`sell_value()` refunds a fraction of (`settings.SELL_REFUND_FRACTION`) -- selling isn't just base
`cost` * fraction.

### Stats panel subject resolution, and a click-routing gotcha

`Game._stats_panel_subject()` resolves what the sidebar shows, in priority order: the tower
currently under the mouse > a tower pinned open by clicking it (`self.selected_tower`, persists
after the mouse moves away) > the tower type currently selected to build > nothing. `render()` and
`_handle_click()` both call it, so the panel and its action buttons (Upgrade / two Specialize
choices / Sell, built by `ui.build_*_button_rect()`) always agree on which tower they act on.

Upgrade and the first Specialize button **intentionally share the same `Rect`** (`ui.py`,
`ACTION_AREA_TOP`) -- a tower is never both upgradeable and specializable at once, so they occupy
the same panel slot. `Game._handle_click` resolves a click there by the subject's *actual state*
(maxed or not), not by which `if` happens to run first -- get that backwards and a maxed tower's
click silently falls into `try_upgrade_tower` (a no-op once maxed) instead of specializing, which
is exactly the bug the regression tests around `ACTION_AREA_TOP`/`build_specialize_button_rects`
in `test_ui.py`/`test_game.py` exist to catch.

### Waves

`WaveManager` (`waves.py`) is a small state machine: `AWAITING_START` -> `BETWEEN_WAVES` ->
`SPAWNING` -> (loop) -> `DONE`. Wave 1 starts in `AWAITING_START` and never advances on its own --
`skip_delay()` (the HUD's Start/Skip button, or `Space`) is what moves it to `BETWEEN_WAVES` with
the timer zeroed, same as skipping any later between-wave countdown. Every wave after the first
auto-counts down `between_wave_delay` as normal.

### Assets

Every sprite is referenced elsewhere by a logical name (`"tower_basic"`, `"enemy_grunt"`, ...),
never a file path. `AssetManager` (`assets.py`) looks the name up in `SPRITE_MANIFEST` for a
relative path + fallback color/shape; if the file exists under `asset_root` (default `assets/`) it
loads and scales that, otherwise it synthesizes a placeholder (rounded rect / circle with an
outline at normal sizes, a plain flat fill below ~12px so tiny sprites like the map's subtile
mosaic don't collapse into a dot). Dropping in real art is a files-only change -- no code changes
unless filenames differ from the manifest.

### Economy debug flag

`Economy.unlimited_gold` (set via `Game(unlimited_gold=...)`, which `main.py --unlimited-gold`
threads through) makes `can_afford()` always `True` and `spend()` a no-op that leaves `gold`
untouched -- every purchase path (place/upgrade/specialize a tower) needed no changes to support
it. `ui.py`'s HUD shows `"Gold: unlimited"` while it's set.
